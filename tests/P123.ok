SECTION 123.1: EXCEPTION - UNDERFLOW ON VALUE OF
        EXP FUNCTION.

THE OBJECT OF THIS TEST IS TO SEE WHETHER THE PROCESSOR
RECOGNIZES AN EXCEPTION WHEN THE VALUE RETURNED
BY THE EXP FUNCTION IS LESS THAN MACHINE INFINITESIMAL
AND TO ENSURE THAT ZERO IS SUPPLIED ON UNDERFLOW.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING AN EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE FUNCTION AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.


                               BEGIN TEST.

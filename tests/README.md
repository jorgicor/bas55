All the Pxxx.BAS tests come from the *National Bureau of Standards - Minimal
BASIC test programs - Version 2*, published in two volumes on November 1980.
We call them the NBS test programs.

The original publications of the NBS test programs can be found here:

*John Gatewood Ham* did the hard work of compiling them in text format.
He is the author of the *ECMA-55 Minimal BASIC Compiler*. Check it at:

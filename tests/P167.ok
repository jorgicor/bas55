PROGRAM FILE 167: EXCEPTION - EVALUATION OF NUMERIC
        EXPRESSIONS ACTING AS FUNCTION ARGUMENTS.
    ANSI STANDARD 7.5, 8.4, 16.4

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THAT THE RECOVERY PROCEDURES FOR
EXCEPTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE EVALUATION OF NUMERIC
EXPRESSIONS WORK PROPERLY IN CONTEXTS OTHER THAN SIMPLE
ASSIGNMENT OF THE EXPRESSION TO A VARIABLE. SPECIFICALLY,
EXPRESSIONS ARE USED AS ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTIONS.

SECTION 167.1: DIVISION BY ZERO IN AN ARGUMENT TO A
        USER-DEFINED FUNCTION.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) POSITIVE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE ARGUMENT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EVALUATE FNC(5/0), WHERE FNC = COMMON LOG.
EXCEPTION SHOULD BE REPORTED NOW:


RESULT OF FNC(5/0) =  INF 

IF EXCEPTION REPORTED, AND
   RESULT = COMMON LOG OF MACHINE INFINITY, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***

                    END TEST.

SECTION 167.2: ZERO RAISED TO A NEGATIVE POWER IN AN
        ARGUMENT TO AN IMPLEMENTATION-SUPPLIED FUNCTION.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) POSITIVE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE ARGUMENT AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EVALUATE ATN(0^(-5)).
EXCEPTION SHOULD BE REPORTED NOW:


RESULT OF ATN(0^(-5)) =  1.5707963 

IF EXCEPTION REPORTED, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***

                    END TEST.

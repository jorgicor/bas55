SECTION 141.1: MAXIMUM OF GROUP TEST OF RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM FINDS THE MAXIMUM RANDOM NUMBER AMONG FIXED-
SIZE GROUPS AND DETERMINES WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
MAXIMA IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION
FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS OF F(X) = X^T, WHERE T IS THE
SIZE OF THE GROUPS. THE KOMOLGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST IS USED
TO MEASURE HOW WELL THE RESULTS MATCH THE EXPECTATION.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                     BEGIN TEST


    K+ =  .93498499                PERCENTILE FOR K+ =  .82594673 
    K- =  .19927419                PERCENTILE FOR K- =  7.6348462E-2 

PERCENTILES SHOULD BE BETWEEN .05 AND .95

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

# When you get the source from a version control repository, it is not

# generated files depend on the version of the tools you have on your system:
# autoconf, automake, help2man, texinfo, bison, etc
#
# You use this script to generate those files. They should not be in version
# control. We have rules for that in the .gitignore file.
#
# After that, you should be able to do
#
# $ ./configure & make
